        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Giles waley Guest House Booni, a peaceful hideaway in the breathtaking valleys of Booni, Chitral —
            Northern
            Pakistan, surrounded by majestic peaks and untouched natural beauty. Our guesthouse is a place where
            comfort, culture,
            and adventure come together to create an unforgettable experience.</p>

        <p> offer five spacious and beautifully maintained rooms, each with its own neat and clean private washroom,
            ensuring
            complete comfort and privacy. The guesthouse also features a large meeting hall, perfect for gatherings or
            small events,
            and a cozy dining hall where guests can enjoy delicious local and traditional Chitrali food, freshly
            prepared with love
            and local ingredients.</p>

        <p>For those who love to cook, we provide a fully equipped guest kitchen — so you can prepare your own meals if
            you wish.
            With free Wi-Fi, 24-hour hot water, and fresh seasonal fruits, we make sure your stay feels like home, only
            more
            peaceful.</p>

        <p>Step outside, and nature welcomes you. Our guesthouse overlooks a beautiful garden and offers a serene
            riverside view
            where guests can relax, enjoy the mountain breeze, or spend the night under the stars at our dedicated
            camping site.</p>

        <p>Adventure seekers will find their thrill here — paragliding and horse riding are our signature experiences,
            giving you a
            chance to see Chitral’s landscapes from new and breathtaking perspectives.</p>

        <p>Whether you’re here to rest, explore, or reconnect with nature, Giles waley promises comfort, cleanliness,
            and a true
            taste of Northern Pakistan’s hospitality.</p>
